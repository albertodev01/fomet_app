  "infoParagraph1": "Fomet SpA is a company which produces and sells special and natural fertilizers for professional agriculture since 1973; however, the first experimental tests of production go back to 1969. From the beginning, the philosophy of work and development of products has been the application of natural systems and methods during the production phase in the industrial headquarter.\n\nThese methods still include the supervised collection of organic samples of manure and the processing of them through a procedure of exsiccation-concentration-humidification for several months in buffered and covered environment, with the subsequent formulation of multiple fertiliser products able to satisfy the most different and difficult demands of the field.",
  "infoParagraph2": "This kind of approach has always been followed and pursued and it allowed fertilizers to be considered not only as a contribution of nutritional units (a fundamental aspect for regular growth and production of the crop), but also as a more spread and important element concerning the fertility of the soil. This idea has been enhanced over the years and extended to the usage in new and different organic samples, apart from manure, but with the same guarantee of authenticity and of contents.",
  "infoParagraph3": "Fomet SpA aims to realise products that are able to add biological activity and humic constituents to the soil, in order to combat the increasing decline of soil production and the progressive deconstruction of lands.",   
  "infoParagraph4": "The whole variety of products thus includes the most qualified category of organic, organic-mineral and corrective fertilizers, both for conventional, biological and biodinamic agriculture. In this way, the choice can be made among products in powder-form, granular-form, pellet-form or liquid-form. In particular, the usage of these products allows to:",
  "infoParagraph5": "the progressive release of nutritional elements (N, P, K, Mg, Microelements) to avoid sudden lacks of balance to guarantee a constant growth of the vegetative structure;",
  "infoParagraph6": "the possibility of fertilization in autumnal periods without lacks of nutritional elements caused by leaching;",
  "infoParagraph7": "the use of products that contain organic matter allows the intervention on the physical fertility of the soil; this has a positive effect, also for a better absorption of microelements.",
  "infoParagraph8": "Through the years, Fomet has gained a solid technical experience which supports the usage in land of their own fertilizers; the company organizes informative and demonstrative meetings, guided tours around the factory and collaborates with several institutes of research and experimentation for the development of products. Fomet also arranges sessions with schools and groups of technicians.",
  "question1": "How are Fomet products distributed?",
  "answer1": "Our products can be distributed with the traditional means of shedding. The pellet product can be better handed out through disk spreader (single or double) or localized with the appropriate tracking device and anchors for the landfill. The powder product should be distributed through a wagon mixer and/or cylindrical disk spreader. The speed of progress will be adjusted in the light of the dosage of use of the product.\n\nLiquid wares, based on their application, will be distributed through sprayers or traditional sprinklers (mechanical/manual atomizer, irrigant wing, sprinkler irrigation...) and also through localized irrigation (micro-irrigation, irrigant hose...); dosage and directions of use must always be shown in the data sheet of every product.\n\nThe distribution of liquid and solid products (powder, pellet and microgranular) is linked to the specific cultivation management, as well as to the fixed goals for every cultivation.",
  "question2": "Burying of products or superficial distribution?",
  "answer2": "Considering the varying of soil characteristics, we recommend to distribute solid products (pellet and powder ones) on the surface and to incorporate them to the soil through the last process. Check the data sheets for better information on distance and depth of burial.\n\nFor grassed fields, it is better to spread the product on the surface and to subsequently mow the grass (process that can be performed in a single step); the aim is to increase the organic matter in the soil and to decrease the speed of weathering, keeping at the same time a balanced nitric Nitrogen content in the soil.\n\nThis operation is joint to the next processing of the field and to the burial of stubble and green manure. The superficial shedding is encouraged when the product landfill is tied to agro-environmental conditions, sloping fields and where the landfill is not achievable.",
  "question3": "What does microbiologically active mean?",
  "answer3": "Fomet products contain colonies of useful micro-organisms which allow the increase of natural evolution of organic matter in the field. The MO presence in the production phase enables the accumulation of organic complexes (humic acids, fulvic acids) that are necessary to mantain the soil \"alive\", equipped with a solid structure and rich in nutritional substance that permit the agricultural production. The absence of pathogens and harmful micro-organisms is certified.",
  "question4": "What does organic fertilization mean?",
  "answer4": "By adding nutritional substances of organic origin, it is possible to manage the soil fertility. Organic fertilization, besides increasing the water retention capacity, also helps the improvement of the structure, as well as the che formation of micro- and macro-pores that are helpful for the nutritional substance exchange with water in the field.",
  "question5": "When should the field be fertilized?",
  "answer5": "It depends on cultivation goals: products must be distributed as shown in the data sheets or in the application for public domain Fomet SPA GROWING EQUIPMENT that can be downloaded with Android and iOS.",
  "question6": "Can biological/biodynamic products be used for conventional agriculture?",
  "answer6": "Yes, using organic products for agriculture with conventional management promotes the correct administration of soil fertility. It is strongly suggested to increase the dosage of organic fertilizers with the aim to establish the allocation of organic matter in conventional fields. The rise of organic matter in the soil allows the decrease of environmental impact like leaching and immobilization of nutritional elements in the field. The usage of organic fertilizers improves the efficiency of said nutritional elements and also of the soil in the long run.",
  "question7": "How should the product be stored?",
  "answer7": "It is important to store the products in fresh and dry locations, safe from water and bad weather. They must also be kept away from children and animals. Wrong use can be harmful. Please follow the instructions shown on the packaging."
