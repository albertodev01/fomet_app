# packages

This folder contains a series of Dart and Flutter packages that are used by the FometApp application. Instead of putting everything inside the `lib` folder of the main project, we prefer to split (where possible) features into independent packages. Here's a quick overview:

| Name | Type | Purpose |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| `fomet_api_client/` | Dart package | HTTP client that communicates with the Fomet servers |
| `fomet_ui` | Flutter package | Component library of the FometApp application |

For more information and context about each package, check their README files.
